# Classifier
#### Introduction 
The aim of Part 1 of this task was to write a supervised learning based classifier to determine whether a given email is spam or not. I did this using a Naive Bayes solution which uses an algorithm to detemine the probability of whether a give message belongs to either the spam or ham class, then the message is then classified based on the Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimate.
